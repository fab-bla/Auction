# Motivation:  The Importance of Public Auctions

Auctions are a vital tool for governments to procure contracts. For construction contracts, first price sealed bid auctions are of particlar importance.

* The authorities of the European Union for example spent around 14\% of their GDP on public procurement in 2017 [@GarciaRodriguez2020].

* Similar observatios can be made for the U.S. economy, one state of particulat importance for this thesis is Colorado. 

* In 2021 the Budget for Transportation in Colorado amounted to roughly \$2 billion. Out of this Budget the CDOT awarded \$790 millions worth of contracts to construct design and repair bridges and highways. All of those contracts were procured via first price sealed bid auctions.

# Thesis Overview

* Provide an award price prediction model for the Colorado Department of Transportation.

  + This model would enable the auctioning entity to plan their budget more accurately.
  
* Unsupervised Collusion Detection

  + Examine whether the interaction of certain bidders has an effect on award prices. A signigicant interaction effect could allude to bid rigging schemes.

# Data: Source

An example of a bid tab, as published on the website of the CDOT.

```{r, out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Bid Tab Example"}

```

# Data: Extraction

* The following text based data was extracted utilizing the package *pdftools* and regular expressions [@pdftools]:
  + Contract ID
  + County
  + Contract Time
  + Contract Description

* The table containing the bids, the unique bidder intentifiers and the engineer's estimate was extracted utilizing the R package *tabulizer* [@tabulizer].
